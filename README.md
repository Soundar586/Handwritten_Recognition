# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition System using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a deep learning–based handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The system accurately recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) from images by learning visual patterns from the MNIST dataset and applying robust preprocessing techniques to handle real-world handwritten inputs.

An interactive web interface is provided using Streamlit for easy image upload and prediction.

## 🧩 Image Preprocessing Strategy
To ensure correct predictions for real-world images, the following preprocessing steps are applied:

1. Convert image to grayscale  
2. Invert colors to match MNIST format  
3. Apply thresholding to remove noise  
4. Detect and crop digit using contours  
5. Resize digit to 20×20  
6. Center digit in a 28×28 frame  
7. Normalize pixel values to range [0,1]  

This alignment significantly improves prediction accuracy on user-uploaded images.
